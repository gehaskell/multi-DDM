Analyse_Epithelix_func is a GUI that allows to run the DDM algorithm on a series of microscopy videos.

The most important files are DDM_Analysis, that contains the class on which this project was based, and DDM_core, which is just the implementation of the DDM algorithm.

The other files are necessary for these three to run.

The analysis software was targeted towards the analysis of a non-standard video format on a customly modified microscope, might require additional work to be adapted to other formats/microscopes/cameras as well.

example_cl.m is an example script of how the GUI can be bypassed for command-line-only analysis.
